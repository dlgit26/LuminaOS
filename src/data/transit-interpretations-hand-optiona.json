Mars and Venus are complementary \nprincipies that both strongly determine the nature of sexual attraction. Venus rules \nthe mutual attraction between two people and the desire for a relationship, while \nMars rules the ego's need for gratification. Psychologists are aware that sexual \nrelationships in ali animal species show characteristics both of a \"loving relationship\" \nand of combat. This dichotomy is true in humans as well and is particularly strong \nduring this transit. \nSexual relations at this time may lack real tenderness. You seem to-be using sex as a \nway to dom\u00ednate your partner, and you may find it difficult to give as much to your \npartner as you want to get. This can create a situation in which one of you feels that \nthe other has stolen !ove rather than allowed it to be freely given. Consequently this \ntransit can lead to conflict between the two of you. Sex tends to have no real \nemotional commitment now, and to be nothing more than the desire for release from \nphysical tension that is part of the sex drive. \nHowever, all that is really necessary is to make sure that your partner is in a similar \nframe of mind as yourself. Then there is very little likelihood that either of you will \nexploit the other. \nlf you suppress your sexuality in platonic relationships with the opposite sex at this \ntime, you may become irritable and feisty. This effect may be so subtle that you are \nnot even aware of what is happening at the time.

You often \nfeel as if your personal freedom is unduly limited by others. Separations sometimes \ncome about because you feel that that is the only way to achieve freedom. And, in \nfact, you are usually better off after a separation that occurs under this transit. \nLike so many other transits of Saturn, this one represents a time of cutting back and \nfinding a more stable form for your life. It is not a time of growth and expansion. In \nfact, too much expansion in the past may be the reason for what is happening now.

The sixth house is a house of \nservice, by which astrologers mean that you should place the needs of others above \nyour own ego-gratification. The classic notion of the sixth house is work done for the \nsake of someone else, usually an employer or other such person. But this kind of \nwork does not square very well with the ego-oriented energy of Mars. You may not \nwant to work for someone else; instead, you want the credit for your \naccomplishments yourself, so that you are identified with what you do. This can lead \nto conflicts with your superiors and general difficulty in your work situation. Even if \nyou are the employer, there may be difficulty if the people who work for you feel that \nyou are not giving them enough credit. The best soluti.on is to maneuver yourself into \na position where you don't have to work with or for others any more than necessary. \nIf you are not self-employed, that is a problem, but you may be able to get sorne \nwork that requires working alone and depends largely upon your individual \ninitiative.

Your thinking will be less subject to the limitations \nimposed by these attitudes. Consequently your attitude toward the world around you \nwill be much more generous, understanding and tolerant of other people's differences. \nYou are less likely to be influenced by prejudices. lnstead, you will want to know \neverything on the basis of your own experience. \nYour plans for the future will be larger and more expansive. You will realize that \nmany of the limitations that you thought were imposed from without are actually \nself-imposed. Also, in looking at the world, you take more factors into consideration \nand plan more effectively than you might at other times. Just be careful not to go to \nthe opposite extreme and overdo it. Don't commit yourself to projects that you \ncannot possibly fulfill. \nAs a general rule, communication with others is better than usual now. You are able \nto say what is on your mind, and you are less subject to failures of communication. \nAt the same time you are frank and willing to talk about every aspect of a given \nproblem, whether it relates to your emotional life or to sorne situation in the outer \nworld.",

At this time you will focus on your \ninnermost personal and domestic life, for this is the area that requires work now. Any \nproblems in your domestic life will become more critica! at this time, and anything you \nhave been \"putting up with\" but not really handling will have to be dealt with. \nConsequently the effects of this transit range from a simple reorganization of your \ndomestic environment to a total reshuffling of the personal relationships and contacts \nthat affect your domestic life. Your home itself may become a tremendous burden \nbecause of payments, repairs or other such responsibilities. \nElements that used to be important in your life often come back into prominence now, \nespecially if they were never resolved in the past. Therefore this is an especially good \ntime to get in touch with your innermost self through psychotherapy or other \nconsciousness-raising and consciousness-expanding techniques. \nDuring this time you may have to take on a parental responsibility for someone, not \nnecessarily your own child, or you may seek out someone who will play a parental role \nfor you. If you do find a \"parent,\" however, make sure that this situation will \nultimately lead to independence on your part. Be certain that it is a growth relationship \nfor you and not the beginning of a long-term dependency, which would prove \ndetrimental in the years to come. \nAt this time a period of severa! years' preparation is coming to an end. You are ready \nto emerge from comparative dormancy, at least in terms of outward success, and begin \nto move upward and forward to achieve your ambitions. But you must start modestly. \nThe fourth house acts as the foundation of your horoscope, and you must pay \nattention to securing and building up this foundation. This is what l\u00edes behind your \n320 \nSaturn \noutward concern with your physical home. It is really the inner \"house\" that you are \nattending to, which is the reason that this is such a good time to be involved in \npsychotherapy. lnner problems that you do not clear up now will be the source of most \nof the problems along your personal road during the next fourteen years. The \nfourth house is opposite the tenth house of career and social status. Any negative \nfactors al work here will oppose your successful achievements later. This is a time of \nnew beginnings, so gel off to a good start.",

Although the fifth is usually \nconsidered the house of recreation and amusement, Saturn's transit through it is not \nlikely to be very amusing. It is as if everything in your life has to have sorne teaching \nor learning purpose. During Saturn's transit through the earlier houses, you redefined \nand restructured your inner self. Now you will begin to give that self new form through \ninteraction with others. \nAreas traditionally associated with the fifth house may become a burden at this time. \nYou will have to attend to these matters, for they will not take care of themselves. \nFor example, children may become a heavy responsibility for sorne reason. Love affairs \nmay become quite difficult, especially if they do not permit your newly restructured \nself to be expressed. A love affair may involve an older person who acts almos! as a \nparent to you. Or you may play that role for someone younger. You may first become \naware of certain aspects of yourself through an intense emotional encounter with \nanother person. Even if it is an unpleasant encounter, it can be a positive growth \nexperience. \nDuring this transit you may also simply withdraw from encounters with others. This \nis understandable because every encounter poses challenges, but you should not avoid \nthem anyway. In so doing you are avoiding the experience of what you have become, \nwhich is so necessary for your proper development al this time. If you feel that you \nwant a relationship, but your opportunities seem to be frustrated, examine your real \nfeelings. Usually you will find that you are subconsciously avoiding the people who \nwould be right for you in order to avoid the confrontation you fear. \nThe fifth house is also the house of gambling, speculation and other such risks. \nNeedless to say, these activities are not at ali in accord with the methodical and work\u00ad\ndemanding nature of Saturn. Do not take such risks at this time, for they are not likely \nto work out. \nAnything you produce during this time will be the result of hard work. You will have a \nmuch more disciplined approach to creative activity than you have had in the past. \nThis is as it should be, because again the aim is to understand yourself through \ncareful, disciplined action.

Even if you have not \nreceived much recognition for your efforts in the past few years, you will begin to \nreceive it then. \nThe transit of Saturn through the sixth house can be compared to preparing for a \ndebut. You have to pul everything in order so that you will make the maximum \nimpact. Consequently this is a time of very heavy responsibility and hard work. Al \ntimes your responsibilities may seem overwhelming, and you may not feel equal to the \nchallenge.

        "long": "Saturn in the Seventh House \nThe transit of Saturn through this house represents the culmination of the process that \nbegan about fourteen years ago when Saturn entered your first house. The need then \nwas to redefine yourself in your own terms. Now you need to experience yourself \nthrough one-to-one encounters with others, through partnerships and intimate \nassociations. Close relationships are the area of attention. \nDuring this transit you will discover that your close associations with others test you \nout and make increasing demands. Often these will be sources of difficulty in your life, \nand dealing with them will require great effort on your part. Sorne relationships will \nend, because they demand more than they are worth. This transit often coincides with \na marital breakup. Even a good marriage will have to confront its flaws when one of \nthe partners has Saturn transiting the seventh house. \n322 \nSaturn \nCoworkers will make greater demands upon you than in the past because they see you \nas someone who can accomplish things, and they want you to prove it. This brings us \nto the other major point about Saturn's transit through this house. \nOn entering this house, Saturn\u00b7 has once again come above the horizon of your natal \nchart. This means that your attention is again focused primarily away from your \ninner world, out into the social world. If you have been preparing yourself properly \nduring the last fourteen years, getting to know who and what you really are, what you \ncan do and cannot do, then you will begin to get recognition during this time. But this \nhouse also calls forth tests of your ability through confrontations with others. This \nmay be particularly obvious in your profession, but it applies equally to your personal \nlife. This is another factor in the marital tensions that accompany this transit. The \nbetter you handle such confrontations, the better your relationship will be in the \nimmediate future. Basically the situation is quite simple. You must do the best you can \nat any particular task, and you must understand the nature of your relationships with \nothers. Exactly what are your expectations of them and their expectations of you? \nIn other words, what agreements have you made with others? Once you know, live up \nto them. It is not terribly important what the agreements are, but it is important that \nyou fulfill them. This is the fundamental test of this transit.",

In a \nlarger way it brings into question the greater transformations that you have been going \nthrough. \nIt is not enough simply to know who you are and how you relate to others. You must \nalso come to terms with other people's values. You must learn to live with those values \nand to incorporate them constructively into your life without destroying your own \nindividuality. With Saturn transiting this house, you will become aware of this issue, \noften through conflict with others' values. Other people's resources may be cut off \nfrom you and be unavailable when you think you need them. A concrete example of \nthis would be not getting a bank loan because you have not met the bank's criteria. \nOr in a marriage, your partner may encounter financia) hard times that cut you off \nfrom an accustomed source of income. During this transit you cannot count upon \nothers for any kind of material backing. They may not have the money, or they may \nnot want to share it with you now. It would be a good idea to get into a position where \nyou don't have to depend on anyone else's resources. \nThe eighth house is also the house of major transformations in life, including death. \nHowever, it must be said immediately that your own death is an extremely unlikely \nresult of an eighth-house Saturn transit. If death enters your life at all at this time, \nit is likely to be someone else's. Or you may suddenly become psychologically \nconcerned about your own mortality. You may think about death more often. \nYou have just finished a phase of intense encounter with others, which has enabled you \nto define yourself by becoming aware of how you deal with people.
